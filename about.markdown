# About MinneHONK!
In the tradition of the [HONK! festival of activist street bands](https://honkfest.org) and other HONK! festivals that take place around the world, members of the activist street band [Brass Solidarity](https://brasssolidarity.com) are inaugurating MinneHONK! in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 2025. This unamplified brass band and music festival will uplift and help prepare for the Rise and Remember festivities that take place later in May.

Working within a framework of a plurality of festivals occurring simultaneously, the goal of this festival is to strengthen the community and cultural fabric in a grassroots oriented manner that encourages people to get out and share music, conversations, and time in community. This is being made possible through funding from [Minnesota Humanities Center](https://www.mnhum.org), [Folk Will Save Us](https://www.folkwillsaveus.org), [Rise and Remember](https://riseandremember.org), and community based efforts to organize.

**What's with the loon?**

Geese honk ([because they're geese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLepBbZBx3w)) and that's made them an obvious symbol -- even mascot -- for HONK! festivals. But this is Minnesota, and loons are kind of our thing.
